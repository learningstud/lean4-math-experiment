# Fields

In what follows we shall have occasion to use various classes of numbers (such as the class of all real numbers or the class of all complex numbers).
Because we should not, at this early stage, commit ourselves to any specific class, we shall adopt the dodge of referring to numbers as scalars.
The reader will not lose anything essential if he consistently interprets scalars as real numbers or as complex numbers; in the examples that we shall study both classes will occur.
To be specific (and also in order to operate at the proper level of generality) we proceed to list all the general facts about scalars that we shall need to assume.

If addition and multiplication are defined within some set of objects (scalars) so that the conditions (A), (B), and (C) are satisfied, then that set (together with the given operations) is called a *field*.
Thus, for example, the set $‚Ñö$ of all rational numbers (with the ordinary definitions of sum and product) is a field, and the same is true of the set $‚Ñù$ of all real numbers and the set $‚ÑÇ$ of all complex numbers.

1. Almost all the laws of elementary arithmetic are consequences of the axioms defining a field.
  Prove, in particular, that if $ùîΩ$ is a field, and if $Œ±$, $Œ≤$, and $Œ≥$ belong to $ùîΩ$, then the following relations hold.

2. In familiar systems, such as the integers, we shall almost always use the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication.
  On the rare occasions when we depart from this convention, we shall give ample warning.
  As for "positive," by that word we mean, here and elsewhere in this book, "greater than or equal to zero."
  If 0 is to be excluded, we shall say "strictly positive."

-- (a) Is the set of all positive integers a field?
-- (b) What about the set of all integers?
-- (c) Can the answers to these questions be changed by re-defining addition or multiplication (or both)?

3. Let m be an integer, m ‚â• 2, and let ‚Ñ§‚Çò, be the set of all positive integers less than m, ‚Ñ§‚Çò = {O,1,‚ãØ,m-1}.
  If Œ± and Œ≤ are in ‚Ñ§‚Çò, let Œ± + Œ≤ be the least positive remainder obtained by dividing the (ordinary) sum of Œ± and Œ≤ by m, and, similarly, let Œ±Œ≤ be the least positive remainder obtained by dividing the (ordinary) product of Œ± and Œ≤ by m.
  (Example: if m = 12, then 3 + 11 = 2 and 3¬∑11 = 9.)

  Prove that if ùîΩ is a field, then either the result of repeatedly adding 1 to itself is always different from 0, or else the first time that it is equal to 0 occurs when the number of summands is a prime.
